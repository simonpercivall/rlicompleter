rlicompleter 3 derives from the Python 2.3.4 standard library modules
rlcompleter.py and pydoc.py. It is a modification of rlcompleter.py
that enables completion of imports in the Python interpreter. The
scanning mechanism necessary for package and module discovery (i.e. the
mechanism for determining what is importable in sys.path and in
packages and sub-packages contained in sys.path) derives from the
documentation scanning mechanism found in pydoc.py.
