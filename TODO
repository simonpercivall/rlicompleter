rlicompleter 3.1
==================

1.  Completion of a module name is currently not possible when
    importing from if the name is different from the canonical
    name used in sys.modules.
    
2.  If a module is imported and bound to another name than its
    canonical name in the namespace, it's not possible to
    complete sub-objects when importing from using that name.

3.  Completing multiple sub-objects separated by a comma in a
    "from import" statement is not possible.

4.  If sys.path is changed after initialization of rlicompleter,
    no update of importable modules is done.

5.  Zipped egg files (from setuptools) are currently not
    supported. Initial structure is in place to deal with them,
    but the machinery to scan them and complete on their
    contents is not yet implemented.
